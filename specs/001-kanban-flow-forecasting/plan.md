# Implementation Plan: Kanban Flow Forecasting

**Branch**: `001-kanban-flow-forecasting` | **Date**: 2026-04-17 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-kanban-flow-forecasting/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-kanban-flow-forecasting/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a self-hosted internal web application for kanban teams as a TypeScript modular monolith with a Next.js web UI, a dedicated Node worker, and PostgreSQL-backed local Jira read models. The first release focuses on service-account PAT Jira integration, scheduled plus manual synchronization, percentile-based aging detection, explicit on-hold classification, and story-count Monte Carlo forecasts served from local projections instead of live Jira calls.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x on Node.js 22 LTS  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 16, React 19, Prisma, PostgreSQL 16, pg-boss, Zod, @nivo/scatterplot, @nivo/line, p-retry, p-limit  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL 16 for connection metadata, sync history, normalized Jira data, analytics projections, and forecast cache  
**Testing**: Vitest, Playwright, MSW, Testcontainers  
**Target Platform**: Internal Linux container or VM deployment with network access to self-hosted Jira  
**Project Type**: Web application with separate web and worker deployables in a pnpm workspace monorepo  
**Performance Goals**: Flow and detail reads served from local projections at p95 < 500 ms; forecast responses < 3 s for 10k-20k trials on datasets with at least 60 completed stories  
**Constraints**: Jira Data Center 8.14+ with service-account PAT, scheduled sync every 5-15 minutes plus manual refresh, one active sync per scope, story-count forecasting only, no live Jira dependency on UI request paths, and reliance on existing workspace authentication for user identity and role context  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-tenant internal rollout, one kanban team scope at a time, hundreds of active stories, up to 24 months of history, and low hundreds of thousands of lifecycle events

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Modular Monolith First**: PASS. The plan stays within a pnpm workspace monolith and uses only two deployables that share one codebase and one database.
- **II. Projection-Backed Analytics**: PASS. The design serves flow and forecast views from locally persisted projections rather than live Jira request paths.
- **III. Contract and Schema Discipline**: PASS. The feature has an OpenAPI contract and planned Prisma migrations for schema changes.
- **IV. Test Coverage by Risk**: PASS. The tasks require shared test infrastructure plus contract, integration, end-to-end, and performance validation for the highest-risk areas.
- **V. Operational Safety**: PASS. PAT redaction, single-sync locking, connection health visibility, and stale/unhealthy state handling are included in the design.

## Agent Workflow

- `/speckit.clarify` remains the path for resolving requirement ambiguity before architecture changes are made.
- `/speckit.plan` owns this document and the implementation context shared through `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- `/speckit.tasks` owns the executable backlog in `tasks.md`, and `/speckit.analyze` is the mandatory validation step whenever contracts, schemas, projections, sync behavior, or security boundaries change.
- `/speckit.implement` is the default guided implementation path for targeted work inside chat when a human wants tighter control over sequencing.
- `/speckit.ralph.run` is the autonomous implementation path after `tasks.md` is current and consistency analysis is clean. It can be used to work through the backlog in repeated agent iterations.
- `/speckit.ralph.iterate` is the bounded alternative for completing one work unit or one story slice at a time without launching the full loop.
- Optional `speckit.git.commit` hooks may record checkpoints around constitution, planning, tasking, analysis, and implementation, but they do not replace the validation gates required by the constitution.

```

**Structure Decision**: Use a small pnpm workspace monorepo with one Next.js web app, one Node worker, and shared TypeScript packages for analytics, database access, Jira integration, and shared types. This keeps deployment simple for v1 while separating request traffic from scheduled sync and projection work.

## Delivery Strategy

Use the current spec, plan, tasks, and analysis artifacts as the source package for agent-driven delivery. Human-guided implementation should use `/speckit.implement` for targeted changes, while the Ralph loop can be used to execute the backlog incrementally once the feature remains constitution-compliant and the task list is stable.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations or extra complexity justifications are currently identified.
